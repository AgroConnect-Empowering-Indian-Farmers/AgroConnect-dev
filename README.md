# Backend : 

## Dataset 

### Prepared and Pre-processed the Images of the Crop Diseases to create dataset of 450 + Crop diseases and Pest across India.
#### Data Sources :
-  https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/crop_protection/crop_prot.html
-  https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/
  
### Description
- Feature Extraction: The uploaded image's features are extracted using the pretrained ResNet50 model.
- Cosine Similarity: Each uploaded image is compared with the stored embeddings using cosine similarity. The image with the highest similarity score is considered the best match.
- Disease Prediction: The disease class associated with the most similar image is returned as the predicted disease.
- Fine-tuning the Pretrained Model: After initial testing, fine-tuning the ResNet50 model with dataset to improve the feature extraction for crop disease images.
  
### Collected and Embbeded IPM and Crop Disease Infromation Documents for causes symtoms and treatments.
#### Data Sources :
-  https://icar.org.in/
-  https://dare.gov.in/en
-  https://ppqs.gov.in/

## Models

### Crop Disease  Notebook: Shows the output of predicted disease using CNN Model
- Loads each image from your dataset.
- Extracts the feature embeddings using ResNet50.
- Stores the image path, class (disease name), and corresponding feature vector in features_db

### RAG  Notebook: Shows the ouput for the treatment and causes of the detected disease
- Load the Crop disease management and treatment information pdfs from the directory and create chunks of them.
- Chunks are converted into embbedings using SENTENCE-BERT Model.
- Embeddings are Stored in Index.
- Semantic Search is Carried with respective to query defined for Context Retrival.
- LLM generates Context-Aware Answers accordingly to the context and prompt.
